# Aviation Performance Metrics
 Aviation Performance Metrics(APM) deals with the various performance indices of the aviation industry and can benefit potential passengers, airport authorities and airline companies
 APM provides tourists or passengers, airport authorities and airline companies with a platform for being better aware of the aviation industry through some common benchmarks. It answers when, where and why the delays as well as cancellations happen the most. Moreover, it bridges the gap between human and machine by interactions such as hovering, zooming, brushing, panning and so on.
 Our time variant data (downloaded from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics of the United States) covers all 50 states, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and U.S. Pacific Trust Territories and Possessions, ranging from January 2015 to December 2019.
